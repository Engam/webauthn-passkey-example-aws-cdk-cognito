  <h4>Passkey settings</h4>
  <p>Use button below to register your passkey. I recommend forcing the user to do this on the phone (or on mac if you have both mac and iphone), to prevent the user to use a passwordmanager that isnt supported on phones or is not userfriendly.</p>
  <button (click)="register()" [disabled]="registering">Register your passkey</button>
